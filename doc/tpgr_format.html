<h2>TPGR File Format</h2>
<p>A text file format for storing a directed graph with travel time functions (TTFs) as edge weights.</p>
<hr>
<p>usual file suffix: <b>.tpgr</b></p>
<b>File Format:</b>
<ul>
	<li>A <b>text</b> file.</li>
	<li>The text file contains integer and floating point numbers seperated by [SPACE] or (if stated) by [NEW LINE].</li>
	<li>Every node of the graph has a unique ID from the set {0,...,(number_of_nodes - 1)}.</li>
	<li>Every edge of the graph has a travel time function (TTF) as edge weight.
	 	TTFs are modelled as a <b>periodic piecewise linear functions</b> described by a sequence interpolation points each.
		Note, that TTFs can be <b>constant</b>. This is expressed by the fact that the point sequence has length 1.</li>
	<li>layout:
		<ul>
			<li>[UINT: number of nodes] [UINT: number of edges] [UINT: number of points] [UINT: period] [NEW LINE]</li>
			<li>For all edges:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>[UINT: source node id] [UINT: target node id] [UINT: number of points of this edges TTF]</li>
					<li>For all points describing this TTF:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>[DOUBLE: x-coordinate] [DOUBLE: y-coordinate]</li>
						</ul>
					<li>(Note, that all x-coordinates must increase in a strictly monotonous manner).</li>
					<li>[NEW LINE]</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>NOTE</b> that KaTCH currently expects a hard-wired period of 864000 for TTFs
		(since TTFs must have a period length of 24 hours and the unit of time is 0.1 seconds;
		these requirements can only be changed by changing all relevant spots in the source
		code of KaTCH).</li>
</ul>
